      A tumultulous past. LeekLord, the most underrated within the onion family.
      Exiled by his brothers ShallotSovereign and GreenOnionGod, Our fore father
      LeekLord saught refuge in a new land. Decades pass, and he finds he makes
      a great soup and this cool website where you can click to move your leek to a tile adjacent to your current position. This is our Leek Quest- to move around the board as LEEK.

  <h3>LEEKLORD LORE</h3>

      The old Irish legend that says that St. Patrick was consoling a dying
      woman. She told him that in a vision she had seen an herb floating in the
      air, and that unless she ate it she would die. He asked her what kind of
      herb it was and she told him that it was LEEK. Thus, St. Patrick envoked
      to LeekLord transformed some potatoes into LEEK; she ate them and was
      cured. But envoking LeekLord came with a price. St. Patrick ascended to
      the heavens and began to transform! His hair and nails, now green and
      fibrous; his butt, became white and bulbous; his legs, grow stringy like
      roots! Emotional, St. Patrick began to cry; his tears, potato-leek soup.
      LeekLord suddenly appeared to the hysterical saint.

      Turns out Leeklord was pretty into back-end development in C# and St.
      Patrick was an avid frontend JavaScript developer. When they merged- a
      fullstack leekcoding master was born.
