  <p>A tumultulous past. The leek, the most underrated within the onion family. Exciled by his brothers Shallot and Sweet Yellow, Our fore father LeekLord saught refuge in a new land. Decades pass, and he finds he makes a great soup and this cool website. The old Irish legend that says that St. Patrick was consoling a dying woman. She told him that in a vision she had seen an herb floating in the air, and that it had been revealed to her that unless she ate it she would die. The saint asked her what kind of herb it was. She told him that it looked like rushes. Thus St. Patrick transformed some rushes into leeks; she ate them and was cured.</p>
